02 Arrays and Strings
Test your Knowledge
1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
    String is immutable which means the string content is not expected to change.
    StringBuilder is mutable. It modifies the content in place.
    
2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
    System.Array
    All arrays (e.g., int[], string[], double[,], etc.) implicitly inherit from System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
    We can use Array.sort() method.

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
    int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5}
    int totalLength = numbers.Length
    the totalLength will be 5.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    If the array type is object[], then yes.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    System.Array.CopyTo() creates a new array and copy all items of the original array.
    If you change cloned array, original array stays the same.
    
    System.Array.Clone() won't create a new array. 
    It put the original array into new target with a start index or positions.
